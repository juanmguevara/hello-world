Hi, I'm Juan Guevara and I want to start my coding venture in hopes to learn how to better optomize mundane tasks at work.
This will help utilize my time and mind on things that I actually should be applying my focus on.

The initial reason why I joined a coding bootcamp was because as a Project Engineer working in construction. I saw a lot of outdated tools being used. The construction Industry can be greatly improved if more sophisticated programs were created. At the time when I signed up for bootcamp I was working in a construction company which built apartment complexes. There was a check list utilized by the superintendents which was difficult/annoying for the superintendents to use, but by using it, it gave the office team enough information to know what the progress was out in the field and if there was a hold up at a certain unit and for how long it has been on hold. I helped create this checklist with my basic understanding of google excel. 

This checklist can greatly be improved, and this was one of the incentives for me wanting to learn coding. Additionally, another segment which heavily consumed my time as a project engineer were change orders. I joined the project a quarter of the way in and took over another co-worker’s scope of work since he relocated to another project. I did not know every trades scope of work and fresh out of college this was a hard learning curve for me.

 Having to look through a number of change order and compare them to the trade’s contracted agreement often was a lot of time I had to dedicate to, so I wanted to make a program which would help people who enter mid-project and aid in comparing what was already bought out per contract and what the added costs were. That way we can ensure that no matter who is taking over there will be high trust ability that the cost of work being processed is valid. In the future may be finetune the feature to just process and validate change orders on its own.
 
There is so much improvement available in the construction industry given that a lot of the work done is by human gives a potential of introducing a lot of human error. From past experience I know that there is already a lot that a Project Engineer needs to memorize, given the name of the color that the trellis will be and the finish, or the dates that the wooden benches will be on-site. A Project Engineer has so many responsibilities and work so hard. I think that they need helpful tools to make sure that the job gets completed correctly and its not just rushed in order to meet schedule. This will help the overall budget of such project as well.

Update 07.09.2020:

Graduated from UC Berkeley Extension Bootcamp for Data Analysis & Software. I have learned a lot while at this bootcamp and will be continuing my skills that I have learned. Ever since the COVID epidemic started I have been working hard at my recent job. I switched construction companies. At the end of my bootcamp I was informed from my new construction company that I was being laid off. At this happened June 06, 2020. At first, I thought that this was the worst thing that could ever happen to me given all the hard work that I was putting in. I worked on average 11 hours daily. I then thought well all that time that I spent working I can dedicate it to my coding program and its not like I have anything to lose anymore I can make a change in career if I want to, or I can look for another position as a Project Engineer. Today July 07, 2020 I have decided to keep on with what I have learned from my coding class and pursue a career in web development.
